# ========================================================================

# Note: not reliable, when starting sway from tty not a DM this reports "tty"
# if command -v loginctl >/dev/null ; then
#     string=$(loginctl show-session "$XDG_SESSION_ID" -p Type)
#     string=${string#Type=}
#     printf '%s\n' "$string"

# Note: this is often unset for same reason above
#       when launching sway from tty

# sometimes this works, depends on bin names and paths
pgrep -f wayland-session >/dev/null && isW
pgrep -f /usr/bin/X >/dev/null && isX

# as shitty as this is, seems to be the most effective
# although it doesn't catch DEs that could be either like Gnome
# but, if using Gnome the two cases above should have caught it
