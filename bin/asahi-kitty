# Launch kitty under Asahi M1 GPU drivers
#
# This is a hack around bypassing the OpenGL 3.3 requirement as per Martin
# kitty isn't actually using any of the features past 3.1+ so its silly for
# them to mandate it.
#
# Warning however, you ARE disabling 3.3+ for anything started from within kitty
# That's why we're using this wrapper script and _NOT_ putting it in say your ~/.profile
#
# see suggestoin from Hector Martin here:
# https://old.reddit.com/r/AsahiLinux/comments/zqejue/kitty_not_working_with_mesaasahiedge/j0y1vp3
#

# make sure we actually are on asahi
uname -a | grep asahi >/dev/null || exec kitty "$@"

# TWO SOLUTIONS:

# 1. Override GL Version checks
#    Kitty only really uses 3.1 so the 3.3 mandate is unncessary
export MESA_GL_VERSION_OVERRIDE=3.3 MESA_GLSL_VERSION_OVERRIDE=330

# 2. Force software rendering
#    (not recommended, but if bugs with #1 --^ this will work...)
###############export LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=true

# nohup kitty >/dev/null 2>&1 &
exec kitty -o linux_display_server=wayland -- "$@"
