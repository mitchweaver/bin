# NOTE: This grabs the first result, the "primary" monitor.
#       I would love to get which monitor "has focus" (ie the pointer) instead.
#       If you find a way to do, please pull request.
#
# NOTE2: As xrandr is somewhat slow, I recommend exporting
#        this as a result in your ~/.xsession so it needn't
#        be calculated more than once.
